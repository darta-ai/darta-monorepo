# Darta Development

## Dev Setup

1. Install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) (ArangoDB does not seem to work with minikubeâ€”YMMV).
    1a. run `kind create cluster`
2. Install [devspace](https://devspace.sh/cli/docs/getting-started/installation).
3. In your cluster, create the correct namespace if it does not already exist: `kubectl create namespace arango`.
4. Run `./install_arango.sh`, which will install the ArangoDB Kubernetes operators and create a database cluster.

A [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) service called `arango-dev-cluster-ea` will have been created. You must find the port that it is exposed on. You can do this by running `kubectl get service arango-dev-cluster-ea -o yaml -n arango-cluster | grep nodePort`, or by examining it in [(Open)](https://github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens)[Lens](https://docs.k8slens.dev/getting-started/install-lens/). It will be 5 digits like `31420`, not ArangoDB's usual `8529`, which is only used internally within the cluster.
    1a. If you are using Lens, you can also find the node cluster IP by clicking on the service and looking at the `Endpoints` tab.
    2a. If you are using Lens, you can also find the service external port by clicking on the service and looking at the `Ports` tab.

Visit `https://[[node cluster ip]]:[[service external port]]` in your browser (*note the `https`*) to see the ArangoDB web interface. The default credentials are `root` with no password. You can then set up user `darta` and database `darta` (be sure to specify the correct user, NOT `root`).

## Development

Run `devspace dev` (remember to create a namespace like `darta` first and run `devspace use namespace`). It will print further instructions once you enter your development session.

## Deployment
Each individual, deployable, package has its own docker file and .devspace file. In Lens or OpenLens, navigate to the file and run `devspace deploy`. In the future, we will have github actions trigger a build.
